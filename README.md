# Alchemy Grate
Alchemy Grate is an addon to Thaumcraft 4 which adds a singular block, the Alchemical Grate

The Alchemical Grate provides a clean way to add items into your Advanced Alchemical Furnace: A hopper-like Inventory instead of uncontrolled item spillage.
Simply place an Alchemical Grate in the center of your Advanced Alchemical Furnace and fill it with items you want to break down into aspects.

The Research is located on the Artifice Tab of the Thaumonomicon next to the regular Item Grate and is unlocked after researching Hungry Chests and the Advanced Alchemical Furnace. 
The Alchemical Grate can be found in Thaumcraft's Creative Tab.
